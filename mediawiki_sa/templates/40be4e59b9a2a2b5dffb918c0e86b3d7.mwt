<noinclude>{{subst notice}}</noinclude>Hello, '''{{<includeonly>subst:</includeonly>PAGENAME}}''', and [[Wikipedia:Welcome|welcome]] to the '''Simple English Wikipedia'''! I hope you will be happy helping here.  You should begin by reading these pages: [[Wikipedia:Useful]], [[Help:Contents]], [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]], and [[Wikipedia:how to write Simple English articles|how to write Simple English articles]]. If you want some ideas of which pages to work on, read [[Wikipedia:Requested articles]] or the list of [[Special:Wantedpages|wanted pages]].

Even though it is a good idea to research an article (like looking at the discussion page) before making large changes, please [[:en:Wikipedia:Be bold|be bold]] and try! Any changes you make that are not perfect can be fixed later. We are also working most on [[Wikipedia:Core article|core article]]s and [[Wikipedia:List of articles all languages should have|the most  common topics]] until this Wikipedia grows.

If you want to ask a question or talk with other members, you can visit our version of the "village pump" at [[Wikipedia:Simple talk]]. [[Wikipedia:Administrators|Administrators]] on Wikipedia can also help you with more difficult problems.  You can also ask me for help. The best way to do that is to leave a message on my talk page.  You should always sign your messages on Talk pages by typing "<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>" (four tildes) at the end of your words. 

Good luck and happy editing!<noinclude>[[Category:Welcome templates]]</noinclude>
