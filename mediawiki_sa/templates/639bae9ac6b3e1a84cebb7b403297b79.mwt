| align=center | This article or section is written in the ''"[[second person]]"''.  This means that it is addressed to "you".  Good encyclopedia articles are <u>never</u> addressed to "you", and do not make statements about "you".  Editors can help by cleaning up the article and writing it in another way, so that it does not have the word "you".
